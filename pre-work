#Questions 1
#Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function. The first line of the code has been defined as below.
def hello_name(user_name):
    print("hello_" + user_name.upper())
hello_name("USERNAME!\n")

#Question 2
# Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing
def first_odds():
    for i in range(1,101):
        if i % 2 != 0:
            print(i)
first_odds()

#Question 3
#Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below.
def max_num_in_list(a_list):  
    max = a_list[0]  
    for num in a_list:  
        if num > max:  
            max = num  
    return max

print(max_num_in_list([1,3,45,12,52,510,210]))

#Question 4
# Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false).
def is_leap_year(a_year):
    if (a_year % 4 == 0) and (a_year % 100 != 0):
        print(True)
    elif (a_year % 400 == 0):
        print(True)
    else:
        print(False)
is_leap_year(1996)

#Question 5
# Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The return should be boolean Type.
def is_consecutive(a_list):
    return sorted(a_list) == list(range(min(a_list), max(a_list) + 1))
     
a_list = [1,23,41,14,53,12,15]
print(is_consecutive(a_list))
